# Setup status

Status: **PARTIAL**  
Updated: 2026-11-06 (America/New_York)

## Completed

- Preserved upstream history, license, and attribution at SonoGym commit
  `e67be58334d1a5274f0913af36f56e4b0b7ffe5a`.
- Inspected the actual guidance YAML loader, task registration, asset paths, visualization
  construction, W&B calls, skrl configuration, and `max_iterations` mapping.
- Added configurable external asset/model/config paths without replacing the tracked Python
  `assets` directory.
- Added the `conv`, headless, fixed-seed navigation baseline and disabled both OpenCV and
  PyVista visualization before environment construction.
- Added a real-environment smoke script and separate serial Slurm templates for smoke and PPO.
- Pinned the published asset dataset revision and SHA-256 values. Both archives were downloaded
  and extracted to local staging at `D:\CSSALT\SonogymRuntime`; they are not in Git.
- Added resumable download, CPU-safe preflight, host inspection/install, and dry-run/submit tools.
- Resource templates request one node, one task, four CPUs, one L4 GPU through `hpg-turin`,
  32 GB RAM, bounded walltimes, and account `anest-dept`. No GPU job was submitted.
- Local CPU-safe checks passed for parsing 75 Python files, parsing the baseline YAML, shell
  syntax (Git Bash), asset path resolution, Git ignore guards, diff whitespace, and both Slurm
  dry-runs. The full local package preflight correctly failed because the unrelated Windows
  Python 3.11 environment does not contain the pinned Isaac stack; this is an installation
  blocker, not a GPU-only check.

## Blockers and unverified work

- HiPerGator SSH reached `hpg.rc.ufl.edu` but noninteractive authentication failed with
  `Permission denied (publickey,keyboard-interactive)`. Therefore host/GLIBC/modules/storage,
  scheduler associations/QOS/GPU metadata, Blue path writability, and `anest-dept` usability
  could not be inspected from this session.
- The pinned Conda/pip environment is not installed on HiPerGator. The installer is ready but
  intentionally refuses to install on a login node or another allocation.
- The downloaded local staging copy has not been transferred to Blue storage.
- Isaac Sim extension downloads, NVIDIA EULA acceptance, shader compilation, L4/driver
  compatibility, simulator smoke, and PPO pilot are `NOT_RUN_NO_GPU`.
- Repository publication is tracked separately and must not be reported complete until remote
  privacy, branch, and pushed commit are verified.

Because the cluster environment and Blue assets are incomplete, the project must not be labeled
`PREPARED_GPU_UNTESTED` yet. No engineering claim that SonoGym runs and no scientific claim about
policy learning is made.

## Next action

Restore SSH key/MFA access, copy this repository to the intended Blue path, run
`scripts/setup_hpg.sh --inspect-only`, confirm `anest-dept`, then perform `--install` inside a
four-CPU development allocation. Do not submit either GPU job during setup.
